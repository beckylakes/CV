I am a Junior Software Engineer, recently graduated from Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp, with a strong passion for technology and driven to become a part of a team that values inclusivity, continual growth, and effective communication. With an international background in consulting, translation, recruitment, and education acquired through 4 years of experience as a bilingual professional in Japan, I bring a diverse skill set from strong project management to collaboration, and a solid analytical, problem-solving approach. 

Fueled by a passion to create meaningful impact for customers on a large scale, I embarked on my journey into technology. Throughout my coding experience, I've built a solid foundation in software development principles, showcasing my dedication to technical excellence and innovation. Iâ€™m eager to leverage my diverse background and newly acquired technical skills in a software role, driving both creativity and impactful solutions.
